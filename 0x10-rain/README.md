#### 0\. Rain

Given a list of non-negative integers representing walls of width 1, calculate how much water will be retained after it rains.

-   Prototype: `def rain(walls)`
-   `walls` is a list of non-negative integers.
-   Return: Integer indicating total amount of rainwater retained.
-   Assume that the ends of the list (before index 0 and after index walls[-1]) are **not** walls, meaning they will not retain water.
-   If the list is empty return `0`.
