#### 0\. Linear search in a skip list

Looking for a specific value in a singly linked list always leads to browse every element of the list. A common way to optimize the time complexity of a search in a singly linked list is to modify the list itself by adding an "express lane" to browse it. A linked list with an express lane is called aÂ [skip list].

These function implement the skip list searches for a value in a sorted skip list of integers.
